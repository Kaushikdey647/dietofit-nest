- **User Management**: Roles, profile, and subscription data
- **Metrics**: Daily/weekly health metrics, derived calculations (BMI, fat mass, etc.)
- **Meal Logging**: Per-meal food logs, validated against a food DB
- **Meal Plans**: Weekly plans assigned by dieticians/nutritionists
- **Checklist**: Daily adherence tracking (water, exercise, meal compliance)
- **Reports**: Weekly/monthly summaries, SaaS analytics
- **Health Checks**: `/healthz` endpoint for DB status
- **Swagger API Docs**: Interactive OpenAPI docs at `/api`
- **Extensible DB Driver Layer**: Unified health checks, initialization, and CRUD
- **Comprehensive Unit Tests**: Jest-based, modular, and easy to extend

## üß© Data Model

### Entities

- `User`: name, age, gender, height, goal, activityLevel, medicalConditions, roles
- `Subscription`: planType, status, trialEnd, renewalDate
- `MetricRecord`: userId, weight, fatMass, lbm, smm, waterPercent, timestamp
- `MealLog`: user, mealType, foods[], date
- `MealPlan`: user, plan[], startDate, endDate
- `Checklist`: user, waterIntake, exerciseDone, mealFollowed, date

### Relationships

- Users have many metrics, meal logs, checklists, subscriptions, and meal plans
- Meal plans and logs are per-user, per-day

## ü©∫ Health Checks

- `/healthz` returns `{ postgres: 'ok'|'error', mongo: 'ok'|'error' }`
- Modular DB driver interface for extensible health, CRUD, and test logic

---

## üß™ Testing

- Run all tests:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
- Unit tests for all services, repositories, and health checks

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Usage

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Configure environment:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set DB URIs, ports, etc.
3. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```
4. **View API docs:**
   - Visit [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api)
5. **Check health:**
   - Visit [http://localhost:3000/healthz](http://localhost:3000/healthz)

## üß† Extending & Customizing

- Add new DBs by implementing the `DatabaseDriver` interface
- Add new modules/services/controllers using NestJS CLI
- Use DTOs and validation for all request bodies
- Add more health checks or SaaS analytics as needed

## üìè Flexible Metrics & Derived Calculations

The `MetricRecord` entity and metrics API are designed for maximum flexibility and extensibility:

- **Flexible Input:** The `/metrics` endpoint accepts any combination of observable and derived metric fields in the request body.
- **Builder Pattern:** All derived/calculated fields (e.g., BMI, bodyFatPercent, waistToHipRatio) are defined via a dependency DAG and mathjs formulas in the entity. No hardcoded logic‚Äîjust add a formula and dependencies to extend.
- **Automatic Enrichment:** On every metric record creation, the service uses `MetricRecord.buildAll(record)` to calculate and enrich all possible derived fields, even if not present in the request.
- **Type-Safe & Robust:** The builder is fully type-safe, cycle-safe, and production-ready. All dynamic property access is checked, and extensibility is as simple as adding a new formula.
- **Multi-DB Save:** Enriched records are saved to both MongoDB and Postgres, with all calculated fields included.

### Example: Adding a New Derived Metric

To add a new derived metric (e.g., `fatFreeMassIndex`):

1. Add a public field to `MetricRecord` with a `@Column` decorator.
2. Add its dependencies and formula:
   ```ts
   static fieldDependencies = {
     ...existing code...
     fatFreeMassIndex: ['lbm', 'height'],
   };
   static formulas = {
     ...existing code...
     fatFreeMassIndex: 'lbm / (height * height)',
   };
   ```
3. That's it! The API will now accept, calculate, and persist this field automatically.

### Example Request

```json
POST /metrics
{
  "userId": 1,
  "weight": 80,
  "height": 1.8,
  "fatMass": 16
}
```

The response and stored record will include all derived fields (e.g., `bmi`, `bodyFatPercent`) calculated from the provided data.
